# Overview - Miscellaneous

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'

This section of the documentation contains miscellaneous documents, i.e., documents for which we do not (yet) have a better place.

The following documents exist:
- **[Notations and Conventions](/docs/miscellaneous/notations-and-conventions)** is a document that specifies the notations and conventions we use in figures of [conceptual models](@).
- **[Tool Development](/docs/miscellaneous/tool-development)** provides (pointers to) information that people may need in order to decide whether or not to contribute to the construction of the Terminology Engine v2 ([TEv2](@)) toolbox, and if so, determine where to help out.
