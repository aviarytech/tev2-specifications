:::caution
The entire section on Terminology Engine v 2 (TEv2) is still under construction.<br/>
As TEv2 is not (yet) available, the texts that specify the tool are still 'raw', i.e. not yet processed.<br/>[readers](@) will need to see through some (currently unprocessed) notational conventions.

This document specifies the contents of the [Human Readable Glossary](hrg@) file ([HRG](@)).

A [HRG](@) is a [glossary](@) is meant to be readable by humans, so that they can find out the meaning of [terms](@) as they are used in the context in which that [glossary](@) is valid. Thus, [HRGs](@) come in human readable formats, such as HTML or PDF.

[HRGs](@) are generated by the [HRGT](@) [tool](/docs/tev2/spec-tools/hrgt), which allows its output to be highly customized. For example, the tool expects that its user specifies
- the set of [terms](@) that need to be included;
- the particular way in which a [term](@) (and its description) appear in the [HRGT](@) 
- any attributes (e.g. contributors, authors, license information etc.) need to be part of such a description, or need to be mentioned in the beginning or the end of the [HRG](@)
- etc.
## File naming conventions

Within (the [glossarydir](@) of) a particular [scopedir](@), we can generate (or import) and hence find all [HRG](@)-files that are needed within that [scope](@). We use the following file naming convention:

**`hrg.<scopetag>.<vsntag>.<output>`** is the name of a file that contains an actual [HRG](@), or it is a file that links (references) such a file, where:
  - **`<scopetag>.<vsntag>`** is taken from the [MRG](@)-file from which the [HRG](@) is generated. See [MRG file naming](/docs/tev2/spec-files/mrg#mrg-file-naming) for details.
  - **`<output>`** is a text that has been provided by the user that generated the [HRG](@). It includes the file extension (e.g., PDF, HTML, etc.) that is appropriate for its contents. See [HRG generation](/docs/tev2/spec-tools/hrgt#calling-the-tool) for details.

This naming convention enables tools (as well as [curators](@) and others) that operate within a particular [scope](@), to quickly find a particular [HRG](@) that is relevant for that [scope](@).

:::info Editor's note
We need to decide whether this document actually describes 
- (the possible structures of) HRGs, or
- the ways in hwich the generation of an HRG can be specified
