# Converter Profile

A **converter profile** is the set of [moustache variables](@) that are (made) available to [converters](@) of a particular [TEv2 tool](@), enabling them to produce the texts by which the [TEv2 tool](@) will replace the text constructs that are located by the [interpreter](@). 

The [specifications of the particular TEv2 tool](/docs/category/toolbox-specs) contain a section called "Converter Profile" that specifies this.

:::info Editor's note
We could perhaps add references to appropriate sections of relevant tools, so that readers can see examples of this.
:::

The generic workings of [converter profiles](@) is documented in the [TEv2 Text Conversion pattern](/docs/overview/tev2-text-conversion).
