# Terminology Under Construction

A **Terminology Under Construction** is a set of [terms](@) (that is initially empty), to which [terms](@) can be added or removed as specified by [term selection instructions](@), so as to ultimately result in a proper [terminology](@).

The list of [term selection instructions](@) that are used to create a [terminology](@) (an an associated [MRG](@)) that is being curated within a [scope](@), are in the [`versions` section](/docs/spec-files/saf#versions) of the [SAF](@) of that [scope](@).
