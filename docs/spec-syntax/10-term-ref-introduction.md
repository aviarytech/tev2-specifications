# Term References - Introduction

As an [author](@) or [curator](@), you want to be able to mark words or phrases, and have them refer to (the documentation of) a particular [concept](@) or other [semantic unit](@). Such marked-up words or phrases are called [TermRefs](@).

The following syntaxes can be used out-of-the-box for [TermRefs](@):
- the **[basic (default) syntax](./term-ref-basic-syntax)**, and
- the **[alternative syntax](./term-ref-alt-syntax)**.

## Customizing TermRef Syntax

[TEv2](@) allows [curators](@) or [authors](@) to specify their own syntaxes for [TermRefs](@), as well as associated output formats. This enables them to specify what a [TermRef](@) will look like after it has been rendered.

Selecting and/or specifying the way in which a [TermRef](@) will be rendered is done by properly instructing the [TermRef resolution tool](trrt@) when your text is processed for rendering.

:::info Editor's note
We need some text here that points to the documentation for doing so. This could be e.g. in the [authors manual](/docs/manuals/author) and [curators manual](/docs/manuals/curator), but also in the [TRRT specifications](/docs/spec-tools/trrt), or in some manual that deals with adding rendering plugins.
