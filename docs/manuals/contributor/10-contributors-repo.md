One way in which [curators](@) may decide that [users](@) can contribute, is by enabling them to [create pull requests](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) to the repository that contains the [scope's](@) [corpus](@). The [curators](@) SHOULD specify the procedures, the code of conduct, etc. that support and enable the maturing of these texts, and how it is decided that such texts can become part of the [scope's](@) [corpus](@). That's outside the scope of this document.

## Users contributions

From the [TEv2](@) perspective, [users](@) contribute by creating and changing the markdown pages that describe the various [knowledge artifacts](@), such as  [concepts](@) , [use-cases](@), [mental models](@), etc.

A [user](@) can use [TermRefs](@) to mark the [terms](@) that it wants to be linked to a specific meaning ([knowledge artifact](@)).
