:::note Editor's note:
Text needs to be drafted to work out the idea that LaTeX is a raw text that can be highly configured. For starters, it would be helpful if LaTeX [authors](@) could
- specify [TermRefs](@) in their documents, and
- specify a location where a [glossary](@) could be inserted.

This hasn't been worked out. We may need to specify one or two [LaTeX Macros](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Macros), and some specific plugins for the [TRRT](@) and [HRGT](@) may need to be created.
